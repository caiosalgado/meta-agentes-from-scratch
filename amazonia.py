# Scan this LiDAR raster for geometric shapes (rectangles, circles, straight ditches). Return rough center coordinates for anything ≥ ~80 m across.

# Read this diary text and extract every sentence that mentions a river, compass direction, or distance travelled.

# Given a coordinate and the matching Sentinel-2 scene, tell me in plain English whether the surface patterns look man-made or natural. Include a 0–1 confidence.
